    Welcome on the Canadian Undergraduate Mathematical Congress's
    website, the greatest congress in North America destined to
    undergraduate mathematics students. The next congress will be at
    University of Montreal from the 10th to the 14 of July. It is
    University of Montreal, sitting on top of Mont Royal, who will
    receive the honor of greeting students from everywhere in Canada
    for the twentieth edition of this great reunion.

    The congress offers a unique opportunity to acquire a first
    experience in research for students. By the means of meetings and
    conferences, the CUMC suggests an occasion to create links between
    students from different canadian universities, links which those
    students will benefit from through their entire mathematical
    career. The event also offers the occasion to promote the
    different mathematical fields and offers social networks of key
    persons working in the main fields of applications. Let us quote
    physics, economy, informatics, statistics, the multiple
    engineering sciences and actuarial science.

    The congress reunites more than a hundred and fifty students from
    multiple academic areas who will present to each other subjects
    that fascinate them. It is a very fruitful experience for young
    talented mathematicians to get out of their usual working context
    and meet to speak about their common interests. It is an event
    exempted from competition and we believe that such a context
    encourages exchange and diversity, which is essential for the
    development of mathematics across the country.
