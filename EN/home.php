    Welcome on the Canadian Undergraduate Mathematical Conference's
    website. The CUMC is the greatest conference in North America
    addressed to undergraduate mathematics students. The next event
    will be held from July 10th to July 14th 2013. It is the Université de
    Montréal, sitting on top of mount Royal, who will have the
    honor of welcoming canadian students for the twentieth edition of
    this great reunion.

    The conference offers a unique opportunity to acquire a first
    experience in research for students. By means of meetings and
    conferences, the CUMC suggests an occasion to create links between
    students from different canadian universities, links which those
    students will benefit from throughout their mathematical
    career. The event also offers the occasion to promote
    different mathematical fields and offers an unique opportunity to meet
    key persons working in the main fields of applications, among which
    physics, economy, informatics, statistics, the multiple
    engineering sciences and actuarial science.

  <p>
    The conference reunites more than two hundred students from
    multiple academic areas who will present to each other subjects
    that fascinate them. It is a very fruitful experience for young
    talented mathematicians to get out of their usual working context
    and meet to speak about their common interests. It is an event
    exempted of competitions and we believe that such a context
    encourages exchange and diversity, which is essential for the
    development of mathematics across the country.
