  <h3>Target audience</h3>

  <p>
    The Canadian Undergraduate Mathematical Conference is an event
    organized by students for students. More particularly, it is made
    for undergraduate students. Nonetheless, students from all levels
    of mathematics are welcome to the congress and everyone is invited
    to present a talk as long as the talk is assuming an audience of
    undergraduates.
  </p>

  <p>
    The event is national, which means that students from everywhere
    across the country are encouraged to be there. It is, by the way,
    the diversity associated to the presence of students from each
    region which makes the event so interesting. Even though the
    organization is targetting canadian students, the notoriety of the
    congress attracts students from around the world! Anyone
    interested by the event is invited to be a part of this great
    reunion.
  </p>

  <h3>The great values</h3>

  <p>
    The presence of students from multiple regions across Canada
    reflects one of the great values underneath this event. The heart
    of the CUMC is to promote diversity. This means reuniting all
    great regions from across Canada, but also encouraging diversity
    of opinions and languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do this, the CUMC is distinguished by its total absence of
    competition during the event. The goal is to give a collaborative
    context where everyone is invited to be a part of the
    activities. The approach is mostly focused on meetings, which, we
    hope, will eventually lead to great collaborations.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year, the organization committee wanted to add an extra
    principle on which we should base the CUMC. The objective is to
    organize an eco-responsible event, which means reducing to a
    minimum the ecological consequences associated to everything
    concerning organization. Scientifics agree more than ever in
    climate change at a global scale and it becomes more and more
    important to take action. Hence the next congress will try to
    reduce its impact on the environment.

  <h3>Method of operation</h3>

  <p>
    The CUMC consists of a series of talks on mathematics which
    participants present to each other. The schedule is built so that
    multiple talks of equal length are presented at the same
    time. This way, anyone can find a subject of his/her own
    interest. On a volunteer basis, participants are invited to
    present a talk on the subject of their choice in front of the
    other participants. It is a very enlightening experience, whether
    it is for the speaker who is practicing his communication skills
    or for the spectator that learns a lot on multiple subjects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between the student talks, participants are invited to attend
    keynote speakers conferences. Those talks are a little bit longer
    and will be given by speakers invited by the organization
    committee. Those talks will be an occasion to reunite all the
    participants and ensure visibility on each of the great branches
    of mathematics.

  <p>
    If you are thinking about attending the congress, we invite you to
    consider presenting a talk. If the experience intrigues you, you
    will find more information in
