  <h2>Keynote speakers</h2>

  <p>
    To sum things up, the participants will have the possibility to
    attend eight keynote speakers conferences covering mathematical
    fields as diversified as possible. Those conferences, given by
    teachers or researchers coming from the industry and well known in
    their respective field, will allow CUMC's participants to discover
    the subjects that will be presented to them and enlarge their
    horizons.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will invite not only speakers well known for their scientific
    contributions, but also to good speakers that will transmit their
    intuition and their passion for mathematics to their audience. By
    choosing speakers from fields as distinct as possible, not only
    everyone will find a good talk, but it will make students curious
    about fields of research they might have not encountered before.
